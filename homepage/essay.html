          <p>I remember days at Atlas Park Mall following my mom around to do some shopping, but then getting rewarded with permission to run in the sprinklers that were once there. Now, it’s all replaced with mini food pop ups that serve frozen yogurt, pretzels, and even bubble tea. It’s all different now but in a good way. The air that once held the laughter of kids running through the water is now filled with conversations of teeanagers. I remember going to the now closed down Johnny Rockets after the movies for countless birthdays. The employees would always sing you happy birthday and if you chose for it to be sang backwards, they’d turn their backs to you and sing that way. You always knew what was going to happen when you asked, but you liked that twist on words, so you continued for years. If you were there years ago, you'd see the mini golf and the big high heel shoe obstacle that I could never get past, but now lays a large lawn inplace of it all.  As time passed, this place changed and so did I. It aged with me, creating more memories along the way. </p>
          <p> Over time, this place slowly became a hang out spot for my friends and me. It was a journey to walk there from school. Most of the way consisted of walking past cemeteries where I might calculate the ages that people passed at and subtly reflect on my own life. That’s the thing about Middle Village: cemeteries surround every part of the neighborhood. Even though this neighborhood is surrounded by death, we found a way to enjoy life and the people around us. Once you pass the cemeteries you face society once again and resume your normal life, maybe taking more time valuing what and who is around you. Some people spend hours here visiting the limited number of stores, picking up lunch, or even visiting that new arcade downstairs while others could spend 30 minutes and leave. My friends and I had made the most of the area. We spent days creating a routine where we’d grab a snack at Auntie-Annes and lounge on the new lawn. We’d lay there while families left and new ones came, and while the kids running were slowly replaced with teenagers walking. We’d lay there watching the clouds till it got too dark to read the storefront signs. There’s something comforting about watching the clouds: knowing the clouds would change but never knowing the exact moment when one shape becomes another one completely different. It’s the same thing with life; you never know exactly when you started to grow up, but you did and you can’t help but want to rewind time and look up at those clouds for the first time again. Other days had consisted of us exploring more of our abandoned garage, hoping to take in more.</p>
          <p> I remember finding that garage for the first time. It was a half day of middle school and my friends and I decided to roam around to kill our boredom. We ran deeper through stairways we had never seen before and the sound of people slowly decreased to a silence. Turn after turn and step after step, we came across a sketchy elevator with rust along the buttons. It wasn't the brightest idea to ride it, but the unknown fed our curiosity. As the doors opened, we were faced with a completely empty parking garage. It all seemed like scenes in a movie where a person runs through a garage in hopes to get away from the murderer, but no one is around to help. It had this eerie empty feeling that we just loved. It gave us our own isolated place that’s hard to find in NYC. This garage was different from the other places here. It was worn down but comforting. It was like a hug at the right moment from a stranger. Atlas has hundreds of people walking in and out every day, but we were the ones to find this space that has no one except us. This garage was our spot; the spot where we can be ourselves and not be sucked into the ongoing change of a big city that makes you question everything. It was our escape.</p>
          <p> With Atlas being in NYC it’s not surprising for it to constantly change. When stores close down it feels like someone took something little in your room and replaced it with something else; it’s a small change but not one that goes unnoticed. Once you realize, you’d hate it and want the old back, but as time passes, you’d barely remember what was once there. The key to change having a positive impact on a person without them feeling out of place is it happening gradually over time.</p>
          <p>That’s the thing about New York. Things change, people grow. The hard part of it all is learning to let go of what was then and focus on what is now. It’s a hard balance to maintain, but you will always have your memories of the past and be able to create more in the future.</p>
